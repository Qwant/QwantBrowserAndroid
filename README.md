# Local Development

## Dependency substitutions

You might be interested in building this project against local versions of some of the dependencies.
This could be done either by using a [local maven repository](https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/android-components/contributing/testing-components-inside-app) (quite cumbersome), or via Gradle's [dependency substitutions](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/customizing_dependency_resolution_behavior.html) (not at all cumbersome!).

Currently, the substitution flow is streamlined for some of the core dependencies via configuration flags in `local.properties`. You can build against a local checkout of the following dependencies by specifying their local paths:
- [application-services](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services), specifying its path via `substitutions.application-services.dir=../application-services`
  - This assumes that you have an `application-services` project at the same level in the directory hierarchy as the `reference-browser`.

Do not forget to run a Gradle sync in Android Studio after changing `local.properties`. If you specified any substitutions, they will be reflected in the modules list, and you'll be able to modify them from a single Android Studio window.
