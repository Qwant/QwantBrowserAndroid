experiments.metrics:
  active_experiment:
    type: string
    description: >
      Records the branch name of the active experiment, if the client is enrolled in the
      `reference-browser-test` experiment. This is intended to validate that the service-experiments
      library properly matches clients to experiments and can take action based on a multi-branched
      experiment. This is done by recording the experiment branch name in this string metric which
      allows the experiment to be transparent and unobtrusive to the user.
